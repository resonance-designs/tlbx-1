# Mosaic Granular Device

The Mosaic device is a post-tape granular processor fed by a 4-second buffer.

## Controls

- **Pitch** (bipolar): ±36 semitones around center.
- **Rate**: grains per second.
- **Size**: grain length.
- **Contour** (bipolar): envelope shape.
- **Warp / Spray / Pattern**: position bias, randomness, and ordering.
- **Wet**: dry/wet mix.
- **Detune**: random pitch spread.
- **Rand Rate / Rand Size**: randomization depth.
- **SOS**: sound-on-sound feedback into the buffer.

## Notes

All Mosaic parameters are smoothed to reduce zipper noise.
